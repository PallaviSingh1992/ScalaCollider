h3. branch

NOTE: you have checked out the synthetic-ugens branch. This is an experimental branch which uses UGen classes synthetically generated by the
ScalaCollider-UGens project, and trying to add compile-type rate-checking. The latter is still undergoing massive changes, and a few features
are currently disabled. 

* Where there was @GE@ before, we now have @GE[_ <: Rate]@, where GE is covariant in its
  Rate type parameter, allowing unknown rates to be represented as @GE[Rate]@.
* We started to remove rate _values_ in several places, and they may be eliminated even further,
  as they represent a kind of strange redundancy with the rate type parameter now. This comes with
  the risk of degrading dynamic behaviour, for example the ability to match a graph element and
  map it onto another. This kind of re-writing will be examined further.
* To facilitate such re-writing, on the other hand, graph elements are now _lazy_ which means they
  do not instantly (multi-channel) expand into UGens. The idea is to be able to capture the whole
  expression tree, which then could be used to transform it, to visualize it (before multi-channel
  expansion!), etc.
* In the meantime, the UGens themselves are not represented any more by individual classes but
  only generic classes such as SingleOutUGen. As we expect manipulations to happen at the
  GE level, this keeps the number of classes smaller.
* The SynthDef creation process is now two staged. The GE tree is captured as a SynthGraph which
  in turn expands into a UGenGraph.
* Automatic subtree omission for side-effect-free roots is currently disabled.
* We started to implement type constraints for the rates, but this is all a difficult business and 
  will take more time to find its final shape. You may note, for example, that the constraints often
  are stronger on the ar, kr, ir constructor methods than the direct GE case class constructor.
* the implicit conversion to GraphFunction has been disabled. so instead of @{ }.play@, use @play { }@
* @Multi@ is introduced which wraps graph elements representing true multi-channel signals, that is
  not synthetically expanded signals but for instance UGens which have several outputs (e.g. In, PlayBuf)
* It's not clear whether @Multi@ will be kept or eliminated, as despite the beauty of having good control
  over multi-channel behaviour (e.g. Multi.Joint, Multi.Disjoint) it doesn't compose well, e.g.
  in binary operations. Also due to bugs in Scala 2.8.1, chained implicit conversions are disabled,
  which means you cannot pass in List(1, 2) for a required Multi argument, so you may need to convert
  sometimes explicitly and chained.
* recursive graph generation may require type annotations. specifically all UGen classes now return the
  UGen type itself instead of GE, which comes with the need to annotate vars:

bc. val x = play {
    // pink noise percussion sound :
    val s = Decay.ar(Dust.ar(0.6)*0.2, 0.15) * PinkNoise.ar
    // reverb predelay time :
    val z = DelayN.ar(s, 0.048, 0.048)
    // 6 modulated comb delays in parallel :
    var y: GE[audio] = Mix(CombL.ar(z, 0.1, 
        LFNoise1.kr(for(i <- 0 until 6) yield Rand(0,0.1)).madd(0.04, 0.05), 15))
    // chain of 4 allpass delays on each of two channels (8 total) :
    for(i <- 0 until 4) { y = AllpassN.ar(y, 0.050, List(Rand(0,0.050),Rand(0,0.050)), 1)}
    // add original sound to reverb and play it :
    s+y
}

h3. requirements / installation

ScalaCollider currently compiles against Scala 2.8.1. It requires Java 1.6 and SuperCollider 3.3.1+. It depends on ScalaOSC ( "github.com/Sciss/ScalaOSC":http://github.com/Sciss/ScalaOSC ) and ScalaAudioFile ( "github.com/Sciss/ScalaAudioFile":http://github.com/Sciss/ScalaAudioFile )

The repository contains a project file for Intellij IDEA 10 CE, and project files for sbt. Targets for sbt:

* @clean@
* @compile@
* @doc@
* @package@
* @demo@

The easiest way to install ScalaOSC and ScalaAudioFile is to go into their respective git repository clones, and then for each execute

@$ sbt publish-local@

Afterwards, go back into the clone of the ScalaCollider git repository, and simply run

@$ sbt update@

which should find ScalaOSC and ScalaAudioFile in your local Ivy repository.

h3. running the demo

The demo target starts a REPL and executes the file @console-startup.txt@ which by default imports the necessary packages, creates a server-options builder bound to @so@ and defines a @boot@ method. make sure that @so.programPath@ is set correctly:

@scala> so.programPath = "/to/my/scsynth"@

You might omit this, as ScalaCollider will by default read the environment variable @SC_HOME@. Environment variables are stored depending on your operating system. On OS X, if you use the app-bundle of ScalaCollider-Swing, you can access them from the terminal:

pre. $ touch ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist
$ open ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist

On the other hand, if you run ScalaCollider from a Bash terminal, you instead edit @~/.bash_profile@. The entry is something like @export SC_HOME=/path/to/folder-of-scsynth@. On linux, the environment variables probably go in @~/.profile@.

Finally, to boot the server:

@scala> boot@
