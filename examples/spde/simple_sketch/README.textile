h2. Using ScalaCollider with SPDE

"SPDE":http://technically.us/spde is a really cool project to bring the Processing graphics programming environment to Scala.

To run this example, first build ScalaCollider from the main directory using

pre. $ sbt update publish-local

Then run from within the @simple_sketch@ folder, do

pre. $ sbt update run

The sketch assumes that the environment variable @SC_HOME@ is properly set in order to find scynth.
